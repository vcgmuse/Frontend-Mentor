## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started with laying out the various sections This site was going to use. Then I shaped the divs and segments based on how they were going to be laidout. First the layout was based on a mobile design first followed by the desktop version. I focused on the display flex layout then proceeded with the margin and padding. The next step was to get the styles down with background images followed by fonts and other aesthetics. After working with the style guide and positioning of the the various elements, I worked on the functionality of the page and hide the p tags. I started with the main interaction of the img and if it was clicked. This lead me to show the effects of the img change and paragraph being displayed with display: 'block'. Then I worked on how the changes will affect each other after they have been clicked. If one things hides when another is clicked. After getting most of the functionality down, I worked making the code easier to read. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing that I learned was using css and JS to create dynamic enviroments for users to interact with. In particular the .selected in the css in combination with the JS code used.

### Continued development

I would like to figure out how to handle the spacebar event and making the rest of the elements hide when pressing. I was able to figure out how to do this with the click events, but was a bit harder to figure out with the key.
