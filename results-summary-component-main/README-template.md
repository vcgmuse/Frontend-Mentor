## My process
First started with the general layout and outer shell to innor core approach. I used the concept of building with legos as a perspective to how to handle the layout. I then looked to find any special case situations that need specific attention to detail, moments were special layout need attention or considerations then wrapped those with the needed divs or elements. Then I focused on the general styling color, height, width of components for the mobile version first. Simple put, making sure things were logicaly grouped and their directions set accordingly. I finished up with fine tuning of layout and fontsize and other fine details. Once that was done I used the built in fetch to generate the code for the results based on the JSON file that was provided. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I think that the input section needs to be created and I would like to flesh that out.
