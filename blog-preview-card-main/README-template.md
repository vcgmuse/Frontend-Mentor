## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure HTML, CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to work with images at different @media resolutions and how margin and padding affect them.

### Continued development

I would like to know if there are better practices to get the same results or better. Something that bothers me is the transition between screens when using responsive in the inspect mode.
